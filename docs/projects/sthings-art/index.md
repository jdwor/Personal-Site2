## Description

Like a few million other people, I spent the weekend of Oct. 27, 2017, watching Stranger Things season 2, and the following week dealing with minor withdrawal. To help transition back into my PhD research, I decided to teach myself web scraping and sentiment analysis and to apply them to the show's scripts from seasons 1 and 2. The result was a blog post in which I visualize episode-level emotional trajectories, cluster according to common patterns, and analyze episode-to-episode fluctuations in emotional trends. The post was picked up by FreeCodeCamp and went on to be viewed over 10,000 times (almost certainly more than any of my actual academic research) :shrug:
