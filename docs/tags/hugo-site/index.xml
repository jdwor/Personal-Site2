      <title>Structural brain measures among children with and without ADHD: A cross-sectional US population-based study</title>

      <description>Abstract Structural neuroimaging research has identified a variety of abnormalities in cortical and subcortical structures in children with ADHD. However, studies to date have not employed large, non-referred samples, complete with data on potential confounding variables. Here, we tested for differences in structural MRI measures among children with and without ADHD using data from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, the largest paediatric brain imaging study in the USA.</description>

      <title>Citation inequity and gendered citation practices in contemporary physics</title>
      <link>https://jordandworkin.com/publications/phys-gender/</link>

      <description>Abstract Similarly to many scientific disciplines, neuroscience has increasingly attempted to confront pervasive gender imbalances. Although publishing and conference participation are often highlighted, recent research has called attention to the prevalence of gender imbalance in citations. Because of the downstream effects of citations on visibility and career advancement, understanding the role of gender in citation practices is vital for addressing scientific inequity. Here, we investigate whether gendered patterns are present in neuroscience citations.</description>

      <title>Noise complaint patterns in New York City: Socioeconomic disparities and COVID-19 exacerbations</title>
      <link>https://jordandworkin.com/publications/noise-covid/</link>

      <description>Abstract Excessive environmental noise exposure and noise annoyance have been linked to adverse physical and mental health outcomes. Although socioeconomic disparities in acoustically measured and geospatially estimated noise have been established, less is known about disparities in noise complaints, one of the most common sources of distress reported to local municipalities. Furthermore, although some studies have posited urban quieting during the COVID-19 pandemic, little empirical work has probed this and probed noise complaints during the pandemic.</description>

      <title>Timing-specific associations between income-to-needs ratio and hippocampal and amygdala volumes in middle childhood</title>

      <description>Abstract It is well known that financial disadvantage is associated with alterations in brain development in regions critical to socioemotional well-being such as the hippocampus and the amygdala. Yet little is known about whether family income at different points in development is differentially associated with these structures. Furthermore, little is known about which environmental factors statistically mediate associations between income and subcortical structure. Using a longitudinal birth cohort and linear mixed-effects models, we identified associations between income-to-needs ratio (INR) at 6 timepoints throughout childhood and hippocampal and amygdala volumes at age 7–9 years (n = 41; 236 INR measurements; 41 brain measurements).</description>

      <title>Racial and ethnic imbalance in neuroscience reference lists and intersections with gender</title>
      <link>https://jordandworkin.com/publications/neuro-race/</link>

      <description>Abstract Discrimination against racial and ethnic minority groups exists in the academy, and the associated biases impact hiring and promotion, publication rates, grant funding, and awards. Precisely how racial and ethnic bias impacts the manner in which the scientific community engages with the ideas of academics in minority groups has yet to be fully elucidated. Citations are a marker of such community engagement, as well as a currency used to attain career milestones.</description>

      <title>A local group differences test for subject-level multivariate density neuroimaging outcomes</title>

      <description>Abstract A great deal of neuroimaging research focuses on voxel-wise analysis or segmentation of damaged tissue, yet many diseases are characterized by diffuse or non-regional neuropathology. In simple cases, these processes can be quantified using summary statistics of voxel intensities. However, the manifestation of a disease process in imaging data is often unknown, or appears as a complex and nonlinear relationship between the voxel intensities on various modalities. When the relevant pattern is unknown, summary statistics are often unable to capture differences between disease groups, and their use may encourage post hoc searches for the optimal summary measure.</description>

      <title>Network-driven differences in mobility and optimal transitions among automatable jobs</title>
      <link>https://jordandworkin.com/publications/job-network/</link>

      <description>Abstract The potential for widespread job automation has become an important topic of discussion in recent years, and it is thought that many American workers may need to learn new skills or transition to new jobs to maintain stable positions in the workforce. Because workers’ existing skills may make such transitions more or less difficult, the likelihood of a given job being automated only tells part of the story. As such, this study uses network science and statistics to investigate the links between jobs that arise from their necessary skills, knowledge and abilities.</description>

      <title>The emergent integrated network structure of scientific research</title>
      <link>https://jordandworkin.com/publications/pnas-net/</link>

      <description>Abstract Scientific research is often thought of as being conducted by individuals and small teams striving for disciplinary advances. Yet as a whole, this endeavor more closely resembles a complex and integrated system of people, papers, and ideas. Studies of co-authorship and citation networks have revealed important structural properties of researchers and articles, but currently the structure of scientific ideas themselves is not well understood. In this study, we posit that topic networks may be a useful framework for revealing the nature of conceptual relationships.</description>
