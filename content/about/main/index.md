intro: |
  I am a biostatistician and computational scientist currently working on metascience policy at the [Federation of American Scientists](https://www.fas.org). My work focuses on building and strengthening ties between metascience practitioners and policymakers, with the ultimate goal of improving scientific research, funding, institutions, and incentive structures through experimentation.

  Before joining FAS, I was an Assistant Professor of Clinical Biostatistics at Columbia University and a research scientist at the New York State Psychiatric Institute; my academic research touched on statistical methodology, medical imaging, and mental health. Throughout my career, I have aimed to produce cross-cutting and interdisciplinary work, and am always excited to connect about potential collaborations (so feel free to send me a note at jdworkin@fas.org!)
  
  Some of my favorite recent team-ups include hosting a working group of metascience policy leaders with the [Institute for Progress](https://www.ifp.org), studying how forecasting can be used in scientific grant review with [Alice Wu](https://fas.org/expert/alice-wu/), developing statistical methods for multiple sclerosis research with [Taki Shinohara](https://www.cceb.med.upenn.edu/pennsive/personnel), investigating inequities in scientific citation practices with [Dani Bassett](https://complexsystemsupenn.com/personal) and [Perry Zurn](https://www.perryzurn.com/), and delving into job automation and skill networks with the folks at [The Pudding](https://www.pudding.cool). You can find more details about my work on the [writing](/writing), [research](/research), and [projects](/projects) pages.
