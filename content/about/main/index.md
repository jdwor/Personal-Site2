  I'm a biostatistician and quantitative scientist specializing in statistical methods for neuroimaging and high-dimensional data. I'm currently an Assistant Professor of Clinical Biostatistics (in Psychiatry) in Columbia University's [Mental Health Data Science Division](https://www.columbiapsychiatry.org/research/research-areas/mental-health-data-science), and a Research Scientist at the New York State Psychiatric Institute. I previously received my PhD in Biostatistics from the University of Pennsylvania, and my BS in Psychology from Haverford College. 
  
  Then and now, I have always sought to produce cross-cutting and interdisciplinary work (so please reach out if you'd like to chat or brainstorm collaborations!). Some of my favorite recent team-ups have included developing statistical methods for multiple sclerosis research with [Taki Shinohara](https://www.cceb.med.upenn.edu/pennsive/personnel), investigating inequities in scientific citation practices with [Dani Bassett](https://complexsystemsupenn.com/personal) and [Perry Zurn](https://www.perryzurn.com/), and delving into job automation and skill networks with the folks at [The Pudding](https://www.pudding.cool). You can find a few examples of my most recent work below, and a more comprensive list on the [research](/research) and [projects](/projects) pages.
