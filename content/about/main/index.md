intro: I am a biostatistician and metascientist helping to lead the [Federation of American Scientists](https://www.fas.org)' new Impetus Institute. My work focuses on growing and strengthening the metascience community, with the ultimate goal of improving scientific research, funding, institutions, and incentive structures through experimentation.
 
Before joining FAS, I was an Assistant Professor of Clinical Biostatistics at Columbia University and a research scientist at the New York State Psychiatric Institute; my academic research touched on statistical methodology, medical imaging, and mental health. Throughout my career, I have aimed to produce cross-cutting and interdisciplinary work, and am always excited to connect about potential collaborations (so feel free to send me a note at jdworkin@fas.org!)
 
Some of my favorite recent team-ups have included developing statistical methods for multiple sclerosis research with [Taki Shinohara](https://www.cceb.med.upenn.edu/pennsive/personnel), investigating inequities in scientific citation practices with [Dani Bassett](https://complexsystemsupenn.com/personal) and [Perry Zurn](https://www.perryzurn.com/), and delving into job automation and skill networks with the folks at [The Pudding](https://www.pudding.cool). You can find a few examples of my most recent work below, and a more comprehensive list on the [research](/research) and [projects](/projects) pages.
